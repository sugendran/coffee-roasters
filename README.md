Coffee Roasters Map
===================

When I visit a city I really want to try some of the local roasters
but often it's hard to find them. So here is a map that I'm going to
try and keep up to date. I will add roasters when I find them.

Pull requests welcome! If you don't know how to do a pull request 
please just create an issue in github with as much detail as possible.

In the data folder there is a set of geojson files. One per country to 
help make this managable. This will get pulled together using grunt to
produce a map. If the country file doesn't exist create it please.
